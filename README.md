## Project Description
The goal of this project is to use the dataset provided by King County, WA to make predictions and inferences about housing prices according to potential predictors therein. The focal point is to use multiple linear regression to explore the parameters that correlate with my target variable (sale price) in order to build an acceptable model for analysis. All of the computational work here is done in Python and associated libraries (primarily sklearn). The primary predictor here for price is the Zip code for the associated residence, secondary predictors being the square footage of the associated living space, its waterfront juxtaposition or lack thereof, and ZIP code.
